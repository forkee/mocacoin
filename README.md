What is Mocacoin?
----------------

Mocacoin is a 100% clone of DASH. It adds no new features, isn't innovative and even adds a nice premine for the dev.
Mocacoin was created as a proof that it is really easy to rip off other people's work, create an ICO, premine, ROM without any knowledge and rip off the community.
Mocacoin should not be traded for BTC or FIAT in any way! If i ever find Mocacoin on any exchange (or on an exchange thread in any forum), i will dump the full premine and floor the price so that any traded mocacoin instantly becomes worthless!
